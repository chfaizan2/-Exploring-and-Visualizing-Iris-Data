## DeveloperHub Corporation Internship Task 1:  Exploring and Visualizing Iris Dataset
### Task Objective
The objective of this notebook is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the Iris dataset. The focus is on:

Loading and understanding the dataset

Cleaning and preparing the data

Visualizing the distribution of species and sepal length

### Dataset Used
Dataset Name: Iris dataset (Iris.csv)

Features:

Id

SepalLengthCm

SepalWidthCm

PetalLengthCm

PetalWidthCm

Species

Size: 150 rows, 6 columns (5 numeric features + 1 categorical target)

Species Classes:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica

### Models Applied
This notebook is purely exploratory — no machine learning models were applied. The work focused on:

Data cleaning: Removing duplicates and unnecessary columns

Data visualization: Using bar plots, histograms, and boxplots to explore distributions

### Key Results and Findings
Data Cleaning:

Removed the Id column as it was unnecessary for analysis

No missing values were found

3 duplicate rows were identified and removed

Data Distribution:

Species distribution is balanced (50 samples per species originally, slightly reduced after duplicate removal)

SepalLengthCm varies significantly across species, especially between Iris-setosa and the other two species

Visualizations Created:

Bar plot: Distribution of species counts

Histograms: Distribution of sepal length grouped by species

Boxplot: Sepal length distribution by species, showing clear separability between Iris-setosa and the others

### Observations:

Iris-setosa tends to have smaller sepal lengths compared to Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica

Sepal length distributions for Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica overlap but show distinct medians and spreads
